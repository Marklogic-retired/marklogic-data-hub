/**
 * This demonstrates a simple approach for instantiating a FlowRunnerImpl via a host/username/password and then running
 * all the steps in the ingestion_mapping_mastering-flow flow. Because the ingestion step in that flow defaults to
 * having a relative file path, this example must override "inputFilePath" with an absolute file path in order for the
 * ingestion step to work (a HubProject would normally be used to do that, but this is demonstrating how to run a flow
 * without a HubProject).
 * <p>
 * This example can be run via the "runFlowWithoutProject" Gradle task in this project.
