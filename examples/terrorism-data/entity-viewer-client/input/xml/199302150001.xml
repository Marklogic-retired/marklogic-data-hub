    <addnotes>This is one of two related attacks (cf. 199302150002). Following the attack officials arrested Ms. Adelina Meza Santamaria, age 35, for allegedly parking one of the car bombs in Bogotá. She was discovered by a hospital where she sought treatment for minor blast injuries. Three witnesses saw her leave a car, which exploded, on a busy downtown avenue. According to reports, she allegedly belongs to a terrorist group that is affiliated with fugitive drug lord Pablo Escobar.</addnotes>
