    <addnotes>The Consultative Committee was appointed by the military-installed government to broaden the public's say on government policy. The military formed the government after launching a coup in January 1992 and canceling legislative elections that the Islamic Salvation Front, a fundamentalist group, was winning. Three other high ranking governmental officials had also been assassinated this week. There was no claim of responsibility, but the Islamic Salvation Front is suspected of being involved in the recent attacks. See event ID 199303160001 for more information.</addnotes>
