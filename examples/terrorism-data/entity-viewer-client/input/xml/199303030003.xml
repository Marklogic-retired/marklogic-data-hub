    <addnotes>This incident was part of a multiple attack in which GRAPO also bombed both the building complex that housed Spain's labor ministry and the Spanish employer's association. GRAPO notified authorities from three separate locations about the bombs, in order to allow the police time to evacuate civilians from the buildings. No casualties resulted from the attack. However, the attack on the Spanish employers association caused one minor injury, in which an individual suffered from nervous shock.  Please see event ID # 199303030001 and # 199303030002 for more information.</addnotes>
