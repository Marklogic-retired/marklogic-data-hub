    <summary>02/26/1993: Three bombs planted at the gasworks in Warrington, Cheshire, United Kingdom caused a huge explosion as a container holding millions of cubic feet of gas was destroyed. A fourth bomb failed to go off and was recovered intact. The terrorists broke into the British Gas distribution plant in Warrington simply by cutting a hole in the perimeter fence. A young policeman was shot and injured and a teenage motorist hijacked at gunpoint.</summary>

    <addnotes>In addition to the bombing, a teenage motorist in a Ford Escort was flagged down by three of the perpetrators in the village of Lymm. The driver was bundled into the trunk at gunpoint. The attackers, who were being chased by the police, took the hijacked car and crashed near the Manchester-Cheshire border. The young driver was freed from the trunk uninjured.</addnotes>
