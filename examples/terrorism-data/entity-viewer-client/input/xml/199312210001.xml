    <addnotes>Due to the bomb threats, all six London railway stations served by the line - Victoria, Blackfriars, London Bridge, Charing Cross, Cannon Street and Waterloo East - were also closed. On the London Underground, service was halted on the Central and Northern lines, two of the busiest lines into the business and shopping districts.</addnotes>
