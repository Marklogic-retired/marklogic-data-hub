    <summary>02/04/1993: The Irish Republican Army (IRA) launched a bomb attack on the joint police and army post at Crossmaglen on the south Armagh border in Northern Ireland, injuring one civilian worker and shattering windows in nearby shops and houses. The IRA used a type of cylinder bomb fired from a tractor and trailer parked outside the perimeter fence. Four masked men had hijacked the tractor and trailer used to launch the missile at 9am several miles away at Forkill. The tractor driver was held by two of the men while the other two set off towards their target. The driver was released unharmed after the attack. An army bomb disposal expert was later examining what was believed to be another, unexploded, mortar bomb inside the base.</summary>
