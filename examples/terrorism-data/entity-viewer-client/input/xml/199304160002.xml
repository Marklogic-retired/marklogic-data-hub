    <addnotes>Guido Parro was a lawyer working for Pablo Escobar, head of Cocaine cartel. The bodies were found in the trunk of a stolen tax, with two signs attached to them. One said "what do you think of the trade for the bombing in Bogota, Pablo?" and the other said "you were kidnapped because of your work for Pablo Escobar."</addnotes>
