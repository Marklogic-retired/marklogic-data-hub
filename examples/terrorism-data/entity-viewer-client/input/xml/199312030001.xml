He had recently spoken out in a television interview on behalf of ethnic Albanian refugees from the Serbian province of Kosovo. Vienna's Mayor, Mayor Helmut Zilk, was also targeted and injured from an attack of similar nature. Police arrested two right-wing extremists, Peter B. and Alexander W., for mailing the letter bombs.</summary>

    <addnotes>At least 10 letter bombs were sent, four exploded and six were defused over a four-day period ending on December 6, 1993. All of the recipients were involved in programs to aid refugees from war-torn Yugoslavia or other parts of Eastern Europe. Both accused perpetrators have ties to neo-Nazi groups in Germany. This was one of 4 related attacks (199312030001-02, 199312040001, 199312050002).</addnotes>
