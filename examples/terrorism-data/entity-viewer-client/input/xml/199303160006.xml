    <addnotes>The bombing in Calcutta followed a recent attack just four days earlier in Mumbai, in which 13 bombs killed at least 300 people. Hindu-Muslim violence resulted in the deaths of some 2,000 people last December and January. No claim of responsibility was made for the attacks that injured at 100 and killed at least 60 people.</addnotes>
