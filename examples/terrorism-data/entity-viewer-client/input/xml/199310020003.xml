    <addnotes>The incident took place at 1:45 AM.  Richard Joseph Campos bombed four other buildings in the Sacramento area including the NAACP headquarters, a synagogue, the home of city councilman Jimmie Yee, and the state Office of Fair Employment and Housing building (199307250005, 199310050004, and 199310140009).  After he firebombed the house of Jimmie Yee, Campos called the Sacramento television station KOVR claiming that the Aryan Liberation Front carried out the firebombing of the Japanese American Citizens League.  Campos was the only member of the Aryan Liberation Front.  Before carrying out his bombing campaign, Campos called the White Aryan Resistance (WAR) hotline 34 times to listen to messages from the organizations leader Tom Metzger.  Campos had a WAR poster in his bedroom when he was arrested.</addnotes>
