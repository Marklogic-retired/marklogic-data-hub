    <addnotes>This incident was part of a multiple attack in which GRAPO also bombed both the Integral Steel Corporation and the building complex that housed Spain's labor ministry. GRAPO notified authorities from three separate locations about the bombs, in order to allow the police time to evacuate civilians from the buildings. No casualties resulted from the attack. However, the attack on the Spanish employers association caused one minor injury, in which an individual suffered from nervous shock.  Please see event ID # 199303030001 and                       ID # 199303030003 for more information.</addnotes>
