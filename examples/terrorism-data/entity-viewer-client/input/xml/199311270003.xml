    <summary>11/27/1993: Two incendiary devices made of matchbooks and timers attached to 9-volt batteries were tightly wrapped in paper bags and secured with paper clips, and planted in the Saks Fifth Avenue department store in downtown Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. One device was found by a store clerk, on a seventh floor shelf, and erupted as a security guard tried to open the bag. Later in the evening, a the second incendiary started a fire on the sixth floor in the Christmas tree department. There were no casualties in the incident, and the fire caused minor damage. This incident is linked to three others in which altogether nine incendiary devices were placed in four department stores in Chicago on the same day and the following day. On November 29, the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) sent out a communiqu√© to the Chicago Sun Times as well as faxed the statement to PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) claiming responsibility for the incident and stating the "action signals the start of a new, more intense campaign of economic sabotage against stores that sell fur."</summary>
