    <addnotes>The officer killed was the 54th person to die in violence waged by militants, seeking to oust the government and create a religious state. This was the third bomb in a month in downtown Cairo. A member of Al-Jama a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group) claimed responsibility for the attack, but it remained unclear as to whether or not the claim was valid.</addnotes>
