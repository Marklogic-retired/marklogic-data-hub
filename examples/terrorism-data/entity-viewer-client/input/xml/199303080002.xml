    <addnotes>Nigel McCollum was the fourth employee of the building firm, Henry Brothers, to be killed in an IRA attack. Henry Brothers has refused the IRA's warning to abstain from working with security forces. The attack was the third of its kind on security forces in the last 24 hours. Four injuries and one casualty resulted from the attack.</addnotes>
