    <summary>02/03/1993: The Irish Republican Army (IRA) planted a bomb which exploded on the 9.05am Victoria to Ramsgate underground train. The train was stopped at Kent House station in Penge, south-east London, after officials received warning calls. There were three telephone warnings claiming that there were two bombs aboard the train and the terrorists claimed that the bombs would explode in 30 minutes. The driver of the train was told to make an unscheduled stop at Kent House station where more than 70 passengers were evacuated and the train was badly damaged from the explosion.</summary>

    <addnotes>This is one of two related attacks (cf. 199302030002). This is the first time a bomb has been planted inside a train carriage in England, showing an increased willingness by the IRA to risk civilian casualties. Another bomb exploded at South Kensington Tube station five-and-a-half hours later. Officials received a warning call for this attack as well.</addnotes>
