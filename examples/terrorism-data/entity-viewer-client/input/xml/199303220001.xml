    <addnotes>2 bombs were planted outside of a store branch, "Boots," by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The attack came on the day before Mother's Day. The IRA reported that the attack would occur outside the Boots in Liverpool to police prior to the detonation of the bombs. The IRA strategically positioned the bombs to allow the first bomb to detonate a few seconds before the second bomb, sending people running toward the second bomb. At least 56 people were injured and one casualty resulted from the attack.</addnotes>
