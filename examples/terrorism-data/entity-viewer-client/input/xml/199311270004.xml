    <summary>11/27/1993: Three incendiary devices made of matchbooks and timers attached to 9-volt batteries were tightly wrapped in paper bags and secured with paper clips, and planted in the Carson Pirie Scott's department store in downtown Chicago, Illinois, in the United States. Two devices ignited fires on the sixth floor of the store and a third device ignited in another section of the store. There were no casualties in the incident, and the fires caused minor damage. This incident is linked to three others in which altogether nine incendiary devices were placed in four department stores in Chicago on the same day and the following day. On November 29, the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) sent out a communiqu√© to the Chicago Sun Times as well as faxed the statement to PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), claiming responsibility for the incident and stating the "action signals the start of a new, more intense campaign of economic sabotage against stores that sell fur."</summary>
