    <addnotes>The attack took place at 1:45 AM while Dr. Crist and his family were asleep.  Nine days before the incident an anti-abortion hotline told callers that it was suspected that Dr. Crist had taken a position at the Planned Parenthood clinic.  Moreover, the message stated that "he will be monitored and appropriate action will be taken."</addnotes>
