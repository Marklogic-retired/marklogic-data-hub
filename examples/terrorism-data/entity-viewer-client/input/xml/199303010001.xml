    <addnotes>The 19 year old Palestinian youth, Zyad Salim Silmi, reportedly stabbed at least 9 people. The incident resulted in at least 2 deaths and 7 injuries. Discrepancies were reported between multiple sources on the exact number of wounded victims. Natan Azarya and Gregory Abramov died as a result of the attack. The attack may have occurred as a result of Silmi's frustration at being unable to obtain work. However, Palestinian Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. It is unclear whether or not Silmi executed the attack on behalf of the militant group.</addnotes>
