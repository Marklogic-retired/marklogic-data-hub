    <summary>04/24/1993: The Irish Republican Army set off three bombs within 14 hours in London. In this incident, a man with an Irish accent tried to force the driver of a taxicab to take him to his target of Scotland Yard's headquarters. However, the perpetrator leaped out of the cab long before reaching the destination, leaving the bomb in the car. The taxi driver fled the vehicle before the bomb detonated. There were no casualties from this incident. (The other two attacks targeted a taxicab destined for the Prime Minister's official residence - in the same manner as this instance - and London's banking and stock brokerage district.)</summary>
