Two Cambodian women employed by UNTAC and a child were killed in the attack. The ground assault by four 10-man teams using AK-47 rifles resulted in two UNTAC civilian policemen injured - an Indian and a Ghanaian. A tent used to register voters for the scheduled spring elections was deliberately fired upon. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge was responsible.",
