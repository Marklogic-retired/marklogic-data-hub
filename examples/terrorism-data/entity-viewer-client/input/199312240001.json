The attacks came after an anonymous group claiming to represent \"Muslims who are ready to die for the sake of Islam,\" issued a written warning to the United Nations and private Christian voluntary organizations. The group accused UN workers and aid groups of passing out bibles in the Somali language and distributing items prohibited by Islam, including pornography, alcohol, pork and hashish.",
