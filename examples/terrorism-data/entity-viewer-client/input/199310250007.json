The plane diverted to Niger, and after initial negotiations the hijackers let out more than 100 passengers. After fruitless additional negotiations, Nigerian police stormed the plane on October 28, 1993. Aside from two victims killed in a rescue operation, all were eventually rescued. The four hijackers surrendered, but one of the crew and one of the hijackers were killed during the rescue operation.",
