Ten more people were injured in four other explosions in a dining car, a sleeper coach, and under seats while the trains were traveling to Bombay, Calcutta and New Delhi. No one claimed responsibility for the attack, however officials suspect religious extremists who condemned the demolition of the mosque in the holy town of Ayodhya on Dec. 6, 1992 by Hindu radicals.",
