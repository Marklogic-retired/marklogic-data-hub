    "summary": "12/23/1993: Four masked and armed men entered the grounds of School No. 25, in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, in a mini-van and forced 12 students and their teacher into a bus. The attackers took the hostages and commandeered a military helicopter to fly them to Tehran, Iran. Before taking off, the gunmen forced a bus driver on board, but released three students as well as a soldier who had been seized during negotiations. During the incident the perpetrators demanded a $10 million ransom. After authorities paid the kidnappers, they dumped the stolen military helicopter and its two pilots, their last remaining captives, in Dagestan, Russia. On December 27, 1993 officials captured the four assailants and retrieved the $10 million.",
