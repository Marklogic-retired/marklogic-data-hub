    "addnotes": "The Khmer Rouge killed many ethnic Vietnamese and hundreds of thousands of Cambodians in its reign in the 1970s. A government official claimed to have information that four (opposition) factions were introducing terrorist groups as part of a new anti-Vietnamese terrorist campaign. The violence caused over 2,000 Vietnamese to begin fleeing by boat to Vietnam. The Khmer Rouge denied any involvement in the attack, but the group was still largely suspected of orchestrating the attack. 20 injuries and 2 casualties resulted from the attack.",
