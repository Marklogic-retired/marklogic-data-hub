One bomb exploded behind a wall in Cathedral Road near the Roman Catholic Cathedral, which injured one and killed another one of the men in the patrol. When colleagues ran to their aid, two more bombs exploded simultaneously on the other side of the street, injuring five more. The bombs, each containing 40 pounds of explosives, had been carefully hidden in hollowed-out pillars.",
