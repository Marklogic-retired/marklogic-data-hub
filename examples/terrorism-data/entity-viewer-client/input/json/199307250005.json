After he firebombed the house of Jimmie Yee, Campos called the Sacramento television station KOVR claiming that the Aryan Liberation Front carried out the firebombing of the synagogue.  Campos was the only member of the Aryan Liberation Front.  Before carrying out his bombing campaign, Campos called the White Aryan Resistance (WAR) hotline 34 times to listen to messages from the organizations leader Tom Metzger.  Campos had a WAR poster in his bedroom when he was arrested.",
