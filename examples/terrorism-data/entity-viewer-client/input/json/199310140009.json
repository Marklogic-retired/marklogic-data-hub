Richard Joseph Campos bombed four other buildings in the Sacramento area including the NAACP headquarters, a synagogue, the Japanese American Citizens League, and the home of city councilman Jimmie Yee (199307250005, 199310020003, and 199310050004).  Forty-five minutes after the  firebombing of the government facility, Campos called the Sacramento television station KCRA and claimed the incident on behalf of the Aryan Liberation Front.  The Fair Employment and Housing Department handled claims of discrimination.  Campos was the only member of the Aryan Liberation Front.  Before carrying out his bombing campaign, Campos called the White Aryan Resistance (WAR) hotline 34 times to listen to messages from the organizations leader Tom Metzger.  Campos had a WAR poster in his bedroom when he was arrested.",
