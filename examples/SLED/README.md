## Scenario

This project is regarding Medicare claims which contains variety of data coming from different systems in different formats as follows  

 1. **Patients Claims** that are in Health care standard 837 which is in CSV format
 2. **Member Data** nothing but the patients Data that are coming from two different systems MMIS(Medicate Management Information System) which is a relational system in csv format and CURAM which is and older systems that is main frame based system in xml format
 3. **Member Id card** images that arre in png format which is unstructured data
 4. **Providers data** data regarding physicians in csv format
 
There are three different types of Users:

 1. **DrSmith** Doctor with PII reading permission

## Predefined Flows

The project has flows predefined for integrating the Member data and claims. All flows are run as part of the `./gradlew install` command.

- **Curam**: Has steps for ingesting and mapping Member data from CURAM system.
- **Mmis**: Has steps for ingesting and mapping Member data from MMIS system.
- **Claims**: Has steps for ingesting and mapping Claims Header and Claim Items data.
- **ProviderData**: Has steps for ingesting and mapping Provider data.
- **Mastering**: Has a mastering step for matching and merging duplicate data across the systems.

Custom Gradle tasks are available to run each flow with the pattern `./gradlew run<FlowName>` (e.g., `./gradlew runProviderData`).

## How to Integrate the Data

1. View the `Curam` flow.
2. Ingest the datasets under data/Member-CURAM by running the `ingestCuram` step. This ingests 4 Member documents into the staging database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
3. With the Member data ingested, view the `mapCuram` step to see the mapping expressions that have been configured.
4. Run the `mapCuram` step in the `Curam` flow. This harmonizes the 4 member documents into the final database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
5. View the `Mmis` flow.
6. Ingest the datasets under data/Member-MMIS by running the `loadMMIS` step. This ingests 132 Member documents into the staging database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
7. With the Member data ingested, view the `mapMMIS` step to see the mapping expressions that have been configured.
8. Run the `mapMMIS` step in the `Mmis` flow. This harmonizes the 132 member documents into the final database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
9. View the `Claims` flow.
10. Ingest the datasets under data/claims by running the `loadClaims` step. This ingests 1,004 claim documents into the staging database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
11. With the Claims data ingested, view the `HarmonizeClaims` step to see the mapping expressions that have been configured.
12. Run the `HarmonizeClaims` step in the `Claims` flow. This harmonizes the 1,004 claim documents into the final database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
13. Run the `HarmonizeClaimItems` step in the `Claims` flow. This harmonizes the 6,004 claim documents into the final database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
14. View the `ProviderData` flow.
15. Ingest the datasets under data/ProviderData by running the `IngestProvider` step. This ingests 1,004 Member documents into the staging database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
16. With the Provider data ingested, view the `MapProvider` step to see the mapping expressions that have been configured.
17. Run the `MapProvider` step in the `ProviderData` flow. This harmonizes the 1,004 member documents into the final database. You can view the documents in the Browse Data view.
18. Run the `matchMember` step and then `mergeMember` step in `Mastering` flow to master the Member, Claims and Provider data. This merges documents in the final database. You can view the results in the Browse Data view resulting in 123 mastered records.

## ICD-10 Ontology Concepts

The International Classification of Diseases (Version 10) Ontology is a standardized vocabulary for describing medical conditions. 

The custom mapping function `lookupICD10` is used to find a semantic IRI for a given diagnosis code in the `HarmonizeClaims` mapping step.

The relationship defined in the `ClaimFHIR` model to the `Medical` Concept creates a triple relationship between `ClaimFHIR` and a diagnosis in the ICD-10 Ontology.

````javascript
const config = require('/com.marklogic.hub/config.sjs')
const sem = require("/MarkLogic/semantics.xqy");

// this function looks for a triple in the ICD-10 Ontology with a code value and returns the subject IRI as a string
function lookupICD10(code) {
  const triple = fn.head(xdmp.invokeFunction(() => cts.triples(null, null, fn.string(code), "=", [], cts.collectionQuery("ICD-10")), { database: xdmp.database(config.FINALDATABASE) }));
  return fn.exists(triple) ? fn.string(sem.tripleSubject(triple)): "";
}
