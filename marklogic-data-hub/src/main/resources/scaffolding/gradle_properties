# If specified, the admin username/password combo is used with the ML Management REST API for creating users and roles. This

# users and roles, which can then be used as mlManageUsername/mlManagePassword and mlUsername/mlPassword.

# These properties are also used for connecting to the admin application on port 8001 - e.g. for initializing ML and for
