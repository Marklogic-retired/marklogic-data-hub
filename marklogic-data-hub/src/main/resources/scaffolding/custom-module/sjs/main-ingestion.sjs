  * Performs the main step processing on the given content, returning zero or many content objects. DHF will run this function
  * in query (read-only) mode, as the intent of a step is for it to return content objects that DHF will then handle persisting.
  *
  * The content argument is either a content object, as defined by
  * https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/blob/master/specs/models/ContentObject.schema.json, or it is an array of content
  * objects defined by that same schema. Whether or not content object is an array is determined by the tool ingesting data.
  * For example, when using the DHF mlRunIngest REST transform, content will be a single object. When using the DHF transform for
  * MLCP, content will be an array.
  *
  * @param content either a single content object, or an array of content objects
  * @param options an object consisting of combined options from the runtime options, the step configuration, the flow options,
  *  and the step definition options
  * @returns a content object, or an array of content objects, depending on the tool ingesting data
