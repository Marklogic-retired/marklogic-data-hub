 * Performs the main step processing on the given content, returning zero or many content objects. DHF will run this function
 * in query (read-only) mode, as the intent of a step is for it to return content objects that DHF will then handle persisting.
 *
 * The content argument is either a content object, as defined by
 * https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/blob/master/specs/models/ContentObject.schema.json, or it is an array of content
 * objects defined by that same schema. The argument will be an array if acceptsBatch=true in the step configuration.
 *
 * The function must return a single content object or an array of content objects, defined by the same ContentObject schema
 * referenced above. A returned content object may be the content object that was passed into this function, or it may be a
 * new content object.
 *
 * @param content either a single content object, or an array of content objects
 * @param options an object consisting of combined options from the runtime options, the step configuration, the flow options,
 *  and the step definition options
 * @returns a content object, or an array of content objects
