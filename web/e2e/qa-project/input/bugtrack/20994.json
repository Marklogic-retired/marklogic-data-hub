Danny is suggesting that they should go to docs.marklogic.com directly and not dmc (which redirects to docs.marklogic.com) with version maintained.\r\n\r\nSo,  changes will be to code in server.marklogic.com. Danny also suggested, that with each major release, the link without version should serve the latest version docs ( again change to code in server.marklogic.com).\r\n\r\nThis is what I understood and hope it makes sense. We will use this bug to fix server.marklogic.com.\r\n\r\n"}, {"time":"2016-01-11T03:39:04.578Z", "updatedBy":{"name":"Ganesh Vaideeswaran", "email":"ganesh.vaideeswaran@marklogic.com", "username":"gvaidees"}, "change":{"status":{"from":"Verify", "to":"Will not fix"}, "assignTo":{"from":{"username":"gvaidees", "name":"Ganesh Vaideeswaran", "email":"Ganesh.Vaideeswaran@marklogic.com"}, "to":{"username":"nobody", "email":"nobody@marklogic.com", "name":"nobody nobody"}}, "fixedin":{"from":"", "to":"N/A"}, "hasUnitTests":{"to":"no"}}, "comment":"", "files":[]}], "updatedAt":"2016-01-11T03:39:04.578Z", "renderDescriptionAs":"normal"}
