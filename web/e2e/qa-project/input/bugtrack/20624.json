I don't think RSC are asking for us to list future releases and I understand that this is something we would never do (to be honest, I don't think they care too much about future releases; just information on current releases).\r\n\r\nI think the notification aspect may go hand in hand with the first part of the request where a group email is issued to anyone who opts in (I think we should definitely make people opt in rather than spam every customer with this) and this would have of a workflow of:\r\n\r\n- Updating the table on help.ml.com\r\n- Generating an email making customers aware\r\n\r\nFor each new release.\r\n\r\nI think RSCs concern is that they have to check the page every once in a while to see whether there is a new maintenance release; even when they do this, they have no idea when the maintenance release was made available on DMC.\r\n\r\nHope this clarifies - let's talk about this at some stage and prioritise accordingly.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nA"}, {"time":"2013-03-07T14:38:29.565614-08:00", "updatedBy":{"username":"rpelton", "name":"Rick Pelton", "email":"rick.pelton@marklogic.com"}, "change":{"tofixin":{"from":"", "to":"N/A"}}, "files":[], "show":true}, {"time":"2013-05-24T12:23:28.805599-07:00", "updatedBy":{"username":"rpelton", "name":"Rick Pelton", "email":"rick.pelton@marklogic.com"}, "change":{}, "files":[], "show":true, "comment":"Part 1: Add a column for actual release date in the Supported Server Versions display is a good idea and we should implement.\r\n\r\nPart 2:  We currently send emails to all support contacts that have not opted out (do not send list).
