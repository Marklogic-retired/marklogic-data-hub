Although I did not see any errors after the 'make', the basis package did not get installed properly after unzip and untar on the machine (i.e., basis was not loaded and hence the entity tests failed). Comparing the /opt/MarkLogicBasis between the 5.0 and 6.0 solaris build machines, I found out that there were some files under rlp/lib directory that were missing in 5.0 machine and the directory structure also looked different on the 2 machines.\r\n\r\nCopying the basis package from the 6.0 machine and then trying to install it on the 5.0 machine also did not make a difference.\r\n\r\nHowever, the only thing that seems to be working is copying the installed 'MarkLogicBasis' directory under /opt from the 6.0 machine to the /opt on the 5.0 machine. By working, I mean that the entityEnrich.xml test passes. Although this is good news, there is still one difference. On the 5.0 machine, we see this message on the ErrorLogs:\r\n\r\n2013-02-04 12:12:59.371 Warning: Basis dlsym make_basis_object: ld.so.1: MarkLogic: fatal: mallctl: can't find symbol\r\n\r\nThis warning message does not appear on the 6.0 machine.
