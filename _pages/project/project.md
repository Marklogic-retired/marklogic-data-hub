Before you can get started you need to create a Data Hub Project. You can do this via the QuickStart UI or the Gradle plugin.

- [QuickStart](quickstart.md) - A user interface for developing with DHF. Use QuickStart if you want to get started with DHF quickly. (QuickStart is not supported for production use.)
- [Gradle Plugin](gradle.md) - The Gradle plugin allows you to interact with DHF from the command line. It is supported for production use.
