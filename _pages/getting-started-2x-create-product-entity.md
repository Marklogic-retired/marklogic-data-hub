Entities are the business objects that you will be working with in the hub. For this tutorial we will be using MarkLogic 9's [Entity Services feature](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/entity-services).

Start by <i class="fa fa-hand-pointer-o"></i> clicking on the Entities tab in the top navigation bar.

![Click Entities]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2x/click-entities.png)

1. <i class="fa fa-hand-pointer-o"></i> Click the **dancing wrench icon**.
1. <i class="fa fa-hand-pointer-o"></i> Click the **New Entity** button.
1. Type **Product** into the Title field.
1. <i class="fa fa-hand-pointer-o"></i> Click **SAVE**.

You have just created an Entity, albeit not very useful since we didn't define any properties.
