If you are upgrading both DHF and MarkLogic, you can upgrade them independently of each other as long as you are running a version of MarkLogic Server that is compatible with the DHF version you plan to install. (DHF versions from 2.0.4 to {{ site.data.global.hub_version }} require MarkLogic Server 9.0-5 or later.) If you are running an older version of MarkLogic Server, then you must upgrade MarkLogic Server before upgrading DHF.
