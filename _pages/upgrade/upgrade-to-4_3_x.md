## Upgrade Notes and Procedure

### Upgrade Notes for DHF 4.3

The following security roles changed in DHF 4.3.

  | old roles      | old default users | new roles           | new default users |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | hub-admin-role | hub-admin-user    | data-hub-admin-role | (no default)      |
  |                |                   | flow-developer-role | flow-developer    |
  | data-hub-role  | data-hub-user     | flow-operator-role  | flow-operator     |
  {:.table-b1gray}

You can use your old custom users instead of the new default users. Remember to assign them to the new roles.

{% include note.html type="NOTE" content="If you are deploying to the Data Hub Service on the cloud, note that the new `flow-developer-role` role in DHF is the equivalent of the `flowDeveloper` role in DHS. You must create a user in DHS to assign to the `flowDeveloper` role and add that user's credentials to the `gradle.properties` file you use for DHS (e.g., `gradle-DHS.properties`)." %}

For more information on roles in DHF, see [Security]({{site.baseurl}}/refs/security/).
