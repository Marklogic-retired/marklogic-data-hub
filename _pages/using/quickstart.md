### Quickstart UI

The Quickstart UI is a visual development tool. It's great for showing off the DHF functionality. QuickStart is meant for development and not for running in production. Think of it as a code editor and scaffold generator, not something that runs your enterprise.

The Quickstart UI is distributed as a .war (web application archive) file. This file is a standalone Java application.

#### Where do I get QuickStart?
The .war file is available for download on GitHub:
  [Download QuickStart](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/releases/download/v2.0.3/quick-start-2.0.3.war){:.blue-button}

#### How do I run QuickStart?
You can run it with the following command:

<pre class="cmdline">
java -jar quickstart-2.0.3.war
</pre>
