# Quickstart UI

The Quickstart UI is a visual development tool. It's great for showing off the DHF functionality. The QuickStart is meant for development and not for running in production. Think of it as a code editor and scaffold generator, not something that runs your enterprise.

The Quickstart UI is distributed as a WAR (web archive) file. This file is a standalone Java application.

#### Where do I get it?
The WAR file is available for download on the Github site.  
[Download Now](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/releases/download/v2.0.3/quick-start-2.0.3.war){:.blue-button}.

#### How do I run it?
You can run it by typing:

<pre class="cmdline">
java -jar quickstart-2.0.3.war
</pre>

#### Tell me more
For a good introduction to the Quickstart UI please work through the [Tutorial](../tutorial/2x.md).
