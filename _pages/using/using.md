### Before You Start
First, we encourage you to [understand DHF](../understanding/understanding.md) and work through the [tutorial](../tutorial/).

### Using DHF

This guide follows a typical path for creating an Operational Data Hub with MarkLogic and DHF:

1. [Create a Project](../project/project.md)
1. [Ingest Data](../ingest/ingest.md)
1. [Harmonize Data](../harmonize/harmonize.md)  
1. [Serve Data](../serve/serve.md)
