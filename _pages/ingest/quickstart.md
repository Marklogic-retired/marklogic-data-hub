### Ingest with QuickStart

QuickStart is an easy-to-use user interface for working with the Data Hub Framework.

The following parts of the [tutorial](../../tutorial/) describe the ingest process in QuickStart, from creating an entity to defining and running an input flow:

1. [Create the Product Entity](../../tutorial/create-product-entity/)
1. [Create the Product Input Flow](../../tutorial/create-product-input-flow/)
1. [Load the Product Data As-Is](../../tutorial/load-products-as-is/)

Under the covers, QuickStart uses [MLCP](../mlcp/) to execute its input flows. 

Note that QuickStart is not supported for production use.
