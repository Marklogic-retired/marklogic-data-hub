## Congratulations!
You just created a data hub.

- You loaded two separate data sources from CSV files.
- You modeled two entities.
- You harmonized your data based on the entity definitions.
- Your data is now fully accessible via the [MarkLogic REST API](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/client){:target="_blank"}

A finished version of this tutorial is available here: [Finished Online Shopping Hub Example](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/tree/develop/examples/online-store){:target="_blank"}

## Uninstalling QuickStart

You can uninstall QuickStart by clicking **Settings** in the top navigation and then **UNINSTALL HUB** on the page that appears.
