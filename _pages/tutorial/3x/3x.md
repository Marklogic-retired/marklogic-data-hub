# Getting Started Tutorial for DHF 3.x

## Introducing QuickStart

This tutorial uses QuickStart, an easy-to-use user interface that you can run locally to start working with the Data Hub Framework quickly. With QuickStart, you will have a working data hub in a matter of minutes. No need to worry about deployment strategies or configuration details. Simply run the QuickStart .war (Java web application archive)  and point it at your MarkLogic installation.

_QuickStart is a DevOps tool. It is meant to be run on your development machine to aid you in quickly deploying your hub._

## Before You Start

## Build an Online Shopping Hub
This tutorial will walk you through setting up a simple data hub for harmonizing online shopping data.

Imagine you're a company that sells board games and board game accessories. You've been tasked with creating a data hub on top of MarkLogic. You must load all of your product and order data into MarkLogic and harmonize it for use in a new application.

You will take the following approach:

1. Load product data as-is
1. Harmonize product data
1. Load order data as-is
1. Harmonize order data
1. Serve the data to downstream clients

## Prerequisites

Before you can begin this tutorial and work with the Data Hub Framework, you need to have some software installed.

- **[Oracle's Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)**

  Java versions later than 8 are currently not supported. We have not tested with OpenJDK. Not sure which Java version you have? Run the following from the command line:
  <pre class="cmdline">
  java -version
  </pre>
  If you have version 8, you will see something like the following:
  <pre class="cmdline">
  java version "1.8.0_40"
  </pre>
  The second number denotes the version.

- **[MarkLogic 9](https://developer.marklogic.com/products)**

  Version 9.0-5 or later, installed and initialized. You can view the [official instructions](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/installation){:target="_blank"} for installing MarkLogic.

  Not sure which MarkLogic version you have? Open your web browser to [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001). After logging in, look at the top-left corner for the version info:

  The following video describes how to install MarkLogic on Windows 10:

- **A modern web browser**

  Chrome or Firefox works best. Use IE at your own risk.

## Common Concerns
**I have a MarkLogic instance, but it already has awesome stuff in it. Will this tutorial mess that up?**
No. The Data Hub Framework is installed on isolated databases and application servers. It is possible that the default DHF ports (8010, 8011, 8012, 8013) may already be in use. In that case you will be warned about the conflicts and given the opportunity to change them. The DHF will not harm any existing settings.

**How difficult is it to remove this tutorial when I am finished?**
Easy. Just click Settings in the QuickStart top navigation and then Uninstall Hub on the page that appears.
