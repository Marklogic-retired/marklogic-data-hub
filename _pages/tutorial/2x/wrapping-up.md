## Congratulations!
You just created a Data Hub.

- You loaded two separate data sources from CSV files.
- You modeled two Entities.
- You harmonized your data based on the Entity definitions.
- Your data is now fully accessible via the [MarkLogic REST API](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/client){:target="_blank"}

## Where to go from here

There are other resources available to help you on your MarkLogic Data Hub journey.

- [MarkLogic University](https://mlu.marklogic.com/ondemand/index.xqy?q=Series%3A%22Operational%20Data%20Hubs%22) - Data Hub Framework On Demand Video Courses
- [Data Hub Framework Wiki](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/wiki) - Read about more advanced uses
- [Data Hub Framework Examples](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/tree/develop/examples) - Many examples of how to use the Data Hub Framework
