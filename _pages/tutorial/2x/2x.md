## Building an Online Shopping Hub
This tutorial will walk you through setting up a very simple hub for harmonizing online shopping data.

The story is:

> Our company sells board games and board game accessories. We have been tasked with creating a Data Hub on top of MarkLogic. We must load all of our Product and Order data into MarkLogic and harmonize it for use in a new application. Our approach will be broken down into five main steps.

1. Load Product data As-Is
1. Harmonize Product data
1. Load Order data As-Is
1. Harmonize Order data
1. Serve the data to downstream clients

### In a Hurry?
The finished version of this tutorial is available for you to download and play with. [Finished Online Shopping Hub Example](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/tree/develop/examples/online-store){:target="_blank"}

### QuickStart
This tutorial uses QuickStart, a simple User Interface that you can run locally to start working with the Data Hub Framework quickly. With QuickStart you will have a working hub in a matter of minutes. No need to worry about deployment strategies or configuration details. Simply run the QuickStart war (java web archive) and point it at your MarkLogic installation. _Quickstart is a devops tool. It is meant to be run on your development machine to aid you in quickly deploying your hub._

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the hub, you will need to have some some software installed.

- [Oracle's Java 8 JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) _(We have not tested with OpenJDK)_{:.smaller}  
  **Not sure which version you have?**  
  Try running this from a command line:
  <pre class="cmdline">
  java -version
  </pre>
- [MarkLogic 9](https://developer.marklogic.com/products) _(9.0.1-1 or later, installed and initialized)_{:.smaller}  
  **Not sure?**  
  Open your web browser to [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)  
  After you logon look at the top left corner for the version info:  
  ![Check ML Version]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2x/ml-version-check.png)
- A Modern Browser. _(Chrome or FireFox work best. Use IE at your own risk.)_{:.smaller}

## Common Concerns
1. **I have a MarkLogic instance but it already has awesome stuff in it. Will this tutorial mess that up?**  
  No. The Data Hub Framework is installed on isolated AppServers, Databases, etc. It is possible that the default DHF ports (8010, 8011, 8012, 8013) may already be in use already. In that case you will be warned about the conflicts and given the opportunity to change them. The DHF will not harm any existing settings.
1. **How difficult is it to remove this tutorial when I am finished?**  
  Easy. Simply click on the Settings tab at the top of QuickStart. Then click Uninstall.
