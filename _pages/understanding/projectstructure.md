<!--- DHFPROD-646 TODO a couple intro sentences. Is this a required layout? Suggested layout? The layout created by running some particular setup command? -->

This page describes the directory structure for a Data Hub Framework project.

### build.gradle
This file allows you to use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to configure and manage your data hub instance. Visit the [Gradle website](https://gradle.org/) for full documentation on how to configure it.

### gradle
This directory houses the gradle wrapper. When you provision a new DHF project you get the gradle wrapper. Gradle wrapper is a specific, local version of gradle. You can use the wrapper to avoid having to install gradle on your system.

### gradle.properties
This properties file defines variables needed by the hub to install and run properly. Ideally you would store values here that apply to all instances of your data hub.

### gradle-local.properties
This properties file overrides the variables in gradle.properties for your local environment. If you need to change a value to run locally this is where you would do it.

### gradle-{env}.properties
DHF looks for various environments based on which override files you have in your hub project. You can have as many environments as you like. Simply create a new override file with the environment name after the dash.

For example: gradle-dev.properties, gradle-qa.properties, gradle-prod.properties

### gradlew, gradlew.bat
These are the \*nix and Windows executable files to run the gradle wrapper. Gradle wrapper is a specific, local version of gradle. You can use the wrapper to avoid having to install gradle on your system.

### hub-internal-config folder
This folder contains sub-folders and JSON files used to configure your MarkLogic server. These files represent the minimum configuration necessary for DHF to function. Do not edit anything in this directory. Instead, make a file with the same name and directory structure under the [user-config folder](#user-config-folder) and add any properties you'd like to override.

```
|- marklogic-config
   |- databases
      |- final-database.json
      |- job-database.json
      |- modules-database.json
      |- schemas-database.json
      |- staging-database.json
      |- trace-database.json
      |- triggers-database.json
   |- mimetypes
      |- woff.json
      |- woff2.json
   |- security
      |- roles
         |- data-hub-role.json
      |- users
         |- data-hub-user.json
   |- servers
      |- final-server.json
      |- job-server.json
      |- staging-server.json
      |- trace-server.json
```

Each of the above JSON files conforms to the MarkLogic REST API for creating [databases](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/PUT/manage/v2/databases/[id-or-name]/properties), [mimetypes](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/PUT/manage/v2/mimetypes/[id-or-name]/properties), [roles](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/PUT/manage/v2/roles/[id-or-name]/properties), [users](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/PUT/manage/v2/users/[id-or-name]/properties), or [servers](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/PUT/manage/v2/servers/[id-or-name]/properties).

## plugins folder
This folder contains your server-side modules that get deployed into MarkLogic. You can put any server-side files in here that you like. When deployed to MarkLogic ./plugins is equivalent to the root uri **/**, so a library module at `./plugins/my-folder/my-lib.xqy` would be loaded into the modules database as `/my-folder/my-lib.xqy`. 

The only caveat is that the **entities** folder is reserved for Hub use and is treated as a special case by the deploy process.

### plugins/entities
This folder contains your entity definitions. An entity is a domain object like Employee or SalesOrder. Each entity folder contains two sub-folders: **input** and **harmonize**. DHF has custom logic to handle the deployment of this folder to MarkLogic. 

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input
The input sub-folder contains all of the input flows for a given entity. Input flows are responsible for creating an XML or JSON envelope during content ingest. This folder contains one server-side module for each part of the envelope: content, headers, and triples. You may also optionally include a REST folder that contains custom MarkLogic REST extensions related to this input flow.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/content.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for creating the content section of your envelope.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/headers.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for creating the headers section of your envelope.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/main.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for orchestrating your plugins.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/triples.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for creating the triples section of your envelope.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/REST
This optional sub-folder contains server-side modules (XQuery or JavaScript) and option definitions (XML or JSON) for MarkLogic's REST API.

A typical REST folder looks like this.

```
|- REST
   |- options
   |- transforms
   |- services
```

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/REST/options
This folder contains REST search option definitions (XML or JSON). See the [MarkLogic Query Options Docs](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/GET/v1/config/query/%5B'default'-or-name%5D) for details. Once deployed, these options are available on the STAGING server.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/REST/transforms
This folder contains REST transform modules (XQuery or JavaScript). See the [MarkLogic REST API Docs](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/rest-dev/transforms) for details.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/REST/services
This folder contains REST extension modules (XQuery or JavaScript). See the [MarkLogic REST API Docs](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/rest-dev/extensions) for details. Once deployed, these services are available on the STAGING server.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize
The harmonize sub-folder contains all of the harmonize flows for a given entity. Harmonize flows are responsible for creating an XML or JSON envelope during content harmonization. This folder contains one server-side module for each part of the envelope: content, headers, and triples. It also contains **collector** and **writer** modules as described below. You may also optionally include a REST folder that contains custom MarkLogic REST extensions that are related to this input flow.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/collector.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for returning a list of things to harmonize. Harmonization is a batch process that operates on one or more items. The returned items should be an array of strings. Each string can have any meaning you like: uri, identifier, sequence number, etc.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/content.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for creating the content section of your envelope.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/headers.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for creating the headers section of your envelope.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/input/main.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for orchestrating your plugins.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/triples.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for creating the triples section of your envelope.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/writer.(sjs|xqy)
The server-side module (XQuery or JavaScript) responsible for persisting your envelope into MarkLogic.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/REST
This optional sub-folder contains server-side modules (XQuery or JavaScript) and option definitions (XML or JSON) for MarkLogic's REST API.

A typical REST folder looks like this.

```
|- REST
   |- options
   |- transforms
   |- services
```

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/REST/options
This folder contains REST search option definitions (XML or JSON). See the [MarkLogic Query Options Docs](https://docs.marklogic.com/REST/GET/v1/config/query/%5B'default'-or-name%5D) for details. Once deployed, these options are available on the FINAL server.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/REST/transforms
This folder contains REST transform modules (XQuery or JavaScript). See the [MarkLogic REST API Docs](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/rest-dev/transforms) for details.

### plugins/entities/{entity}/harmonize/REST/services
This folder contains REST extension modules (XQuery or JavaScript). See the [MarkLogic REST API Docs](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/rest-dev/extensions) for details. Once deployed, these options are available on the FINAL server.

## Entity-independent REST resources
In DHF, REST resources (search options, extensions, and transforms) are intended to be associated with entities. As such, they would be created under a `plugins/entities/{entity}` folder. It is currently possible to deploy REST resources from `plugins/entities/input/REST` (without a specific entity); however, this is unsupported and may be removed in a future release. 

### user-config folder
This folder contains sub-folders and JSON files used to configure your MarkLogic server.
See [ml-gradle wiki](https://github.com/marklogic/ml-gradle/wiki) for details on what goes in here.
Any JSON files you put here will be merged with the hub-internal-config configurations by the Data Hub Framework upon deploy.

### .tmp folder
This folder contains temporary hub artifacts. You may safely ignore it.
