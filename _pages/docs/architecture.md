## In General

As far as maintaining data goes, DHF provides the following services:

* manages the flow and integration of data into and through a MarkLogic system.
* records job and tracing metadata.
* exposes code to operate upon data in the hub.

## Databases

In installing a data hub, the following databases are created:

| Database    | Default Name     | Triggers DB       | Schema DB  |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Staging     | data-hub-STAGING | TRIGGERS          | SCHEMAS    |
| Final       | data-hub-FINAL   | TRIGGERS          | SCHEMAS    |
| Jobs        | data-hub-JOBS    | TRIGGERS          | SCHEMAS    |
| Triggers    | data-hub-TRIGGERS| none              | none       |
| Modules     | data-hub-MODULES | none              | none       |

The names of these databases are all configurable using values in `gradle.properties`.

Note: as of 3.1 there is no separate TRACING database.  JOBS holds tracing and jobs info.

### Application Servers

The following application servers are in use by a Data hub:

Appserver   | Default Name     | Default Port      | Modules DB
Final       | data-hub-FINAL   | 8011              | data-hub-MODULES
Staging     | data-hub-STAGING | 8010              | data-hub-MODULES
Jobs        | data-hub-JOBS    | 8013              | data-hub-MODULES

Note: deployment of DHF also makes use of the MarkLogic management API on port 8002.

Data Hub Framework creates the "Final" App Server as a provisioned location
from which to serve your harmonized data. Data Hub Framework does not make use
of this App Server itself.


### REST Extensions

The core of the DHF runs on MarkLogic.  This code is explosed to clients as REST API
extensions, which include both *transforms* and *service extensions*.  These extensions
work identically to other [REST API Extensions](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/rest-dev/extensions) except that they are provided as out-of-the-box for DHF use.

Here is the list of extensions comprising DHF:

#### Transforms:
