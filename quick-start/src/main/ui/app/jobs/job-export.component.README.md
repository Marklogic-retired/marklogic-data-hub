Thoughts on refactoring and scoping out job-export.component
============================================================

1. New presentational component job-export-ui.component.ts should be created
2. job-export-ui.component.ts should be scoped out to library
3. Looks like everything except "jobService" can be easily 
refactored into "job-export-ui"
