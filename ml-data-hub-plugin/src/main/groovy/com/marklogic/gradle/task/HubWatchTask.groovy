 * Runs an infinite loop, and each second, it loads any new/modified modules. Often useful to run with the Gradle "-i" flag
 * so you can see which modules are loaded.
 *
 * Depends on an instance of LoadModulesCommand being in the Gradle Project, which should have been placed there by
 * MarkLogicPlugin. This prevents this class from having to know how to construct a ModulesLoader.
