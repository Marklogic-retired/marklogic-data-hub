# MarkLogic Data Hub

Go from nothing to an Operational Data Hub in a matter of minutes.  

The MarkLogic Data Hub Framework is a data integration framework and tool-set to quickly and efficiently integrate data from many sources into a single MarkLogic database and then expose that data.

# Version Support
MarkLogic 9.0-5 or later is required with this version (3.0.0) of the DHF.

# Getting Started
Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/marklogic/marklogic-data-hub/releases) then visit our [Data Hub Framework website](https://marklogic.github.io/marklogic-data-hub/) to get started.


## Advanced Hub Usage
Ready to go beyond QuickStart and start using DHF in your own Java or Gradle project? The [Data Hub Framework website](https://marklogic.github.io/marklogic-data-hub/) also provides that.
