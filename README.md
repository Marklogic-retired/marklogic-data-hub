# MarkLogic Data Hub

Go from nothing to Operational Data Hub in a matter of minutes.  

This project allows you to deploy a skeleton Data Hub into MarkLogic. With some basic configuration you will be running an Operational Data Hub in no time.

# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need these to get started

- Java 8 JDK
- MarkLogic 8.0-2 or greater
- Gradle 3.1 or greater **(Optional)**

### TL;DR

Head over to our [Getting Started Tutorial](https://marklogic.github.io/marklogic-data-hub/) to get up and running with the Data Hub.

Or watch the [MarkLogic University - Data Hub Framework On Demand Video Courses](http://mlu.marklogic.com/ondemand/index.xqy?q=Series%3A%22Operational%20Data%20Hubs%22)

### The Easiest Way

To use the Data Hub Framework you should download the quickstart.war file from the [releases page](https://github.com/marklogic-community/marklogic-data-hub/releases).

Then Run the war like so:

```bash
java -jar quickstart.war
```

### Using the Hub in your existing Java project

Alternatively you can include the jar file as a build dependency in your Java project. Make sure you reference the latest version.

**Gradle**

```groovy
compile('com.marklogic:marklogic-data-hub:1.1.5')
```

**Maven**

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.marklogic</groupId>
  <artifactId>marklogic-data-hub</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.5</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

**Ivy**

```xml
<dependency org='com.marklogic' name='marklogic-data-hub' rev='1.1.5'>
  <artifact name='$AID' ext='pom'></artifact>
</dependency>
```

### Command Line Ninjas

If you prefer to use gradle for all of your hub interactions then you can include the ml-data-hub gradle plugin in your build.gradle file:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.marklogic.ml-data-hub' version '1.1.5'
}
```

Now you have full access to the Data Hub tasks. To see all available tasks run:

```bash
./gradlew tasks
```
